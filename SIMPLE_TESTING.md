# 🎯 Simple Testing Without Resolver Service

You don't need the resolver service to test swaps! Here's the simplest way:

## ✅ What You Already Have

- ✅ Contracts deployed on Sepolia and Paseo
- ✅ Frontend working at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ No backend/resolver needed!

## 🚀 Simple 2-Person Swap (No Resolver)

### Setup (One Time)

1. **Start Frontend Only**
   ```bash
   cd packages/nextjs
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Open http://localhost:3000/swap** (use the advanced swap page)

### How It Works

Two users can swap directly:

**User A (Has ETH, wants DOT):**
1. Go to `/swap` page
2. Create swap: Lock 0.00001 ETH
3. Generate secret (save it!)
4. Share swap ID with User B

**User B (Has DOT, wants ETH):**
1. See User A's swap on `/swaps` page
2. Create matching swap: Lock 1 DOT
3. Use same secret hash from User A

**User A (Complete):**
1. Go to Paseo chain
2. Reveal secret to claim DOT

**User B (Complete):**
1. Use revealed secret
2. Claim ETH on Sepolia

**Done!** ✅ Atomic swap complete, no resolver needed.

## 🎮 Even Simpler: Self-Swap Test

Test with just YOUR wallet on both chains:

### Step 1: Create Swap on Sepolia
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/swap
2. Direction: ETH → DOT
3. Amount: 0.00001 ETH
4. Taker: YOUR SAME ADDRESS
5. Click "Generate Secret" → SAVE IT!
6. Click "Create Swap"
7. Copy the Swap ID
```

### Step 2: Switch to Paseo Chain
```
1. In MetaMask, switch to Paseo network
2. Refresh page
3. Go to "Find & Participate"
4. Find your swap by ID
5. Click "Participate"
6. This locks your DOT
```

### Step 3: Complete on Paseo
```
1. Go to "My Swaps"
2. Find your swap
3. Enter your secret
4. Click "Complete Swap"
5. You claim your DOT!
```

### Step 4: Complete on Sepolia
```
1. Switch MetaMask back to Sepolia
2. Go to "My Swaps"
3. The secret is now public
4. Use it to claim ETH
```

**Done!** You just did a cross-chain atomic swap yourself! 🎉

## 💡 Why This Is Better

**No Resolver Service:**
- ❌ No RPC configuration
- ❌ No backend service running
- ❌ No private key management
- ✅ Just use the frontend!

**Manual Control:**
- You control every step
- See exactly how HTLCs work
- No automation complexity
- Perfect for testing and demos

## 📱 Frontend Features

Your frontend already has everything:

### `/swap` - Create Swap
- Generate secrets
- Create swaps
- Set exchange rates

### `/swaps` - My Swaps
- View your swaps
- Complete swaps with secrets
- Cancel expired swaps

### `/dashboard` - Browse Swaps
- See all active swaps
- Filter by status
- Find counterparties

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path
1. User A creates swap
2. User B participates
3. User A completes (reveals secret)
4. User B completes (uses secret)
✅ Both get their funds

### Scenario 2: Timeout
1. User A creates swap
2. User B never participates
3. Wait for timelock (12 hours)
4. User A cancels and gets refund
✅ User A protected

### Scenario 3: User B Timeout
1. User A creates swap
2. User B participates
3. User A never completes
4. Wait for timelock (6 hours on Paseo)
5. User B cancels and gets refund
✅ User B protected

## 🎯 Benefits of Manual Testing

1. **Simple** - No complex setup
2. **Educational** - See how HTLCs work
3. **Reliable** - No RPC issues
4. **Flexible** - Test any scenario
5. **No Keys** - No private key exposure

## 🚀 When You Need the Resolver

Only use the resolver service when you want:
- **Automatic fulfillment** for users
- **Liquidity provision** as a service
- **Production deployment** with automation

For testing and understanding the protocol, **manual swaps are perfect!**

## 📊 Current Setup

Your project has both options:

### Option 1: Manual (Simple)
- Use `/swap`, `/swaps`, `/dashboard` pages
- No backend needed
- Perfect for testing

### Option 2: Automated (Complex)
- Use `/swap-simple` page
- Requires resolver service running
- For production users

## 🎉 Recommendation

**Start with manual swaps!**

1. Just run: `cd packages/nextjs && yarn start`
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/swap
3. Test creating and completing swaps yourself
4. No resolver, no RPC, no complexity!

Once you understand the flow, THEN add the resolver for automation.

## 💬 Need Help?

The manual swap flow is already built into your app:
- `/swap` - Create swaps
- `/swaps` - Manage your swaps
- `/complete/[swapId]` - Complete with secret

Everything works without any backend service! 🎊
