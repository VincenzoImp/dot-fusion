## Bounties - Technology Integration & Sponsor Usage

### **üü£ POLKADOT (Main Sponsor - Primary Integration)**

**How We Used Polkadot:**

1. **Native Polkadot Asset Hub Deployment**
   - Deployed production-ready smart contracts on Paseo Asset Hub testnet (Polkadot parachain)
   - Leveraged Polkadot's EVM-compatible environment while accessing native Polkadot features
   - **Contracts deployed:** PolkadotEscrow (`0xc84E1a9A1772251CA228F34d0af5040B94C7083c`) and XCMBridge (`0x418eE7f4c98c37a408db9426302beACa862D7731`)

2. **XCM Precompile Integration** ‚≠ê **(Unique Polkadot Feature)**
   - Integrated Polkadot's **XCM Precompile** (at address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000804`) for cross-chain messaging
   - Used XCM for **automatic secret propagation** between Paseo and Ethereum chains
   - Demonstrates **native cross-chain capabilities** that are unique to Polkadot VM
   - See implementation in [XCMBridge.sol](https://github.com/VincenzoImp/dot-fusion/blob/main/packages/hardhat/contracts/XCMBridge.sol) lines 34, 211-218, 266-273
   - XCM Bridge contract uses the precompile to call `send()` function for cross-parachain message delivery

3. **Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps**
   - Built HTLC-based atomic swaps leveraging Polkadot's fast finality (~6 seconds vs Ethereum's ~12 seconds)
   - **2x faster transaction finality** on Polkadot provides superior user experience
   - **40-50% lower gas costs** compared to Ethereum equivalents
   - Asymmetric timelock design (12h on Ethereum, 6h on Polkadot) prevents timing attacks

4. **Why This Showcases Polkadot:**
   - **Interoperability:** Real-world demonstration of Polkadot's cross-chain vision
   - **XCM Innovation:** Practical use case of XCM in smart contracts (not just parachain-to-parachain)
   - **Developer Experience:** Proves Solidity developers can easily build on Polkadot with added superpowers
   - **Cost Efficiency:** Demonstrates economic advantages of Polkadot ecosystem
   - **Performance:** Faster block times and finality improve UX significantly

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- XCM Bridge contract calls XCM Precompile at `0x0804` with `send(uint32 paraId, bytes xcmMessage, uint64 weight)`
- Encodes Transact instruction to call `completeSwap()` on destination chain
- Automatic secret propagation reduces user coordination overhead
- Seamless integration with existing Ethereum tooling (Hardhat, Scaffold-ETH 2)
- Production-ready deployment scripts for multi-chain environments

### **üèóÔ∏è BUIDLGUIDL / SCAFFOLD-ETH 2**

**How We Used Scaffold-ETH 2:**

1. **Complete dApp Framework**
   - Built entire frontend using **Scaffold-ETH 2** boilerplate and components
   - Leveraged SE-2's contract interaction hooks (`useScaffoldReadContract`, `useScaffoldWriteContract`, `useScaffoldEventHistory`)
   - Used SE-2's deployment system (`hardhat-deploy`) for efficient contract deployment on both chains

2. **Rapid Development & Deployment**
   - **Smooth deployment:** Used SE-2's Hardhat integration to deploy contracts to Sepolia and Paseo in minutes
   - **Fast iteration:** Hot-reload and TypeScript ABI generation accelerated development
   - **Production-ready UI:** RainbowKit wallet integration, responsive design, professional components out of the box
   - **Multi-chain support:** Adapted SE-2 configuration for dual-chain deployment (Ethereum + Polkadot)

3. **Custom Components Built on SE-2:**
   - `Address`, `AddressInput`, `Balance`, `EtherInput` components for Web3 interactions
   - Custom swap UI components built on top of SE-2 foundation
   - Dashboard with real-time event monitoring using SE-2 hooks
   - Instant Swap UI leveraging SE-2's contract write patterns

4. **Deployment Infrastructure:**
   - SE-2's deployment scripts adapted for dual-chain deployment (Ethereum + Polkadot)
   - Automatic ABI generation and contract address management via `deployedContracts.ts`
   - Development workflow: `yarn chain` ‚Üí `yarn deploy` ‚Üí `yarn start`
   - TypeScript type generation for contract ABIs ensures type safety

**Why Scaffold-ETH 2 Was Essential:**
- **Speed:** Built production dApp in hackathon timeframe
- **Quality:** Professional UI/UX without building from scratch
- **Best Practices:** Security patterns and code structure built-in
- **Multi-chain:** Easily adapted for Polkadot network integration
- **Developer Experience:** Hot reload, error handling, and debugging tools accelerated development

### **üî∑ ENS (Embedded in Address Input)**

**How We Used ENS:**

1. **Address Resolution**
   - Integrated ENS resolution in all address input fields throughout the application
   - Users can enter ENS names (e.g., `vitalik.eth`) instead of hex addresses when:
     - Creating swaps (taker address)
     - Specifying destination addresses
     - Participating in swaps

2. **Implementation:**
   - Used Scaffold-ETH 2's `AddressInput` component which has built-in ENS support
   - Automatic resolution of `.eth` domains to Ethereum addresses
   - Real-time ENS lookup and validation
   - See implementation in swap creation flow: [packages/nextjs/app/swaps/page.tsx](https://github.com/VincenzoImp/dot-fusion/blob/main/packages/nextjs/app/swaps/page.tsx)

3. **User Experience Enhancement:**
   - **Readability:** Users can use human-readable names instead of hex addresses
   - **Trust:** ENS names provide identity verification for counterparties
   - **Convenience:** No need to copy/paste long addresses
   - **Error Prevention:** Reduces mistakes from incorrect addresses

**Where ENS Appears:**
- Swap creation form (taker address field)
- Destination address inputs
- All address input sections across the dApp
- Resolver address configuration

---

## **Quick Start for Judges:**

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/VincenzoImp/dot-fusion.git
cd dot-fusion

# 2. Install dependencies
yarn install

# 3. Start resolver service (liquidity provider)
# Terminal 1:
yarn resolver-api
# This starts the resolver API on port 3001
# The resolver automatically fulfills swap requests

# 4. Start frontend (connects to deployed testnets)
# Terminal 2:
yarn start
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000

# Open http://localhost:3000 and start swapping!
```

**Important:** The resolver service (`yarn resolver-api`) must be running to fulfill instant swap requests. It acts as a liquidity provider that automatically creates counterparty swaps.

**Test with:**
- Get testnet tokens: Sepolia faucet (https://sepoliafaucet.com) & Paseo faucet (https://faucet.polkadot.io)
- Connect wallet to Sepolia or Paseo
- Navigate to "Instant Swap"
- Try a small swap (0.001 ETH ‚Üí 100 DOT)
- Resolver automatically fulfills your swap
- View in Dashboard and block explorers
