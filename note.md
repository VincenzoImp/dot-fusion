the protocol il finisced but the frontend can be improved. for example wold be very usefull if all the swap will be resolved to a single address that own both ethereum and dot in order to resolve the swap request from eth to dot and viceversa. so this resolver can be a services, a script runniung that has the private key of 0x address with the funds. this sercices, listen the events, also the event in the front end as an apy if you whant. so for the user the webapp must show only the destination address desired and the amount to swap. the sistem will provide the exchange rate that is fixed by simplify the implementation. with this setup i will verify the correctness and completeness of the project. please implement in simple way but correct way the ideas exposed
